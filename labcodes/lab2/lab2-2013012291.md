# Lab 2

## Ex0

1. Create patch file from my own version of lab1 code and the original copy of lab1 code using 'diff -Nur ...' command and redirect the output to 'patch.diff'.
2. Apply the patch file to lab2 code using 'patch -d lab2 -p1 < patch.diff'. '-d' means the target is a directory and '-p1' means to ignore the first level of dir.

#### How to implement Fisrt Fit Mem Algorithm?

The framework is already implemented and I only need to modify a few of the codes.
1. In *default_init_memmap*, the flag of each page should be set to correct value.
    - Because all 'reserved'-bits are set to 1 prior to this function, whose purpose is to initiallize pages for allocation, those bits should be cleared.
    - On the other hand, because no allocation has actually taken place, all pages are available, which meas the bits for 'property' should be set to 1.
2. In *default_alloc_pages*, the 'property'-bits should be cleared because they are no longer available.
3. In *default_free_pages*, the 'property'-bits should be set because they are available again.
4. Test for 'make qemu' failed. Debugging info shows 

        assert((p0 = alloc_page()) == p2 - 1);

    went wrong. The bug should be fixed.
    - In the implemented FFMA code, the blocks freed is added to the beginning of free_area.
    - So, in the corresponding codes of *default_check*, where p0 is freed first and p1 is freed last, p1 would be at the beginning of the free_area list.
    - Which means when allocating p0 again, p1 is firstly considered, and the position is in p2 + 1 rather than p2 - 1.
    - As *default_check* must not be changed, the logic for FFMA should be adjusted to meet the requirement.
    - My implementation is to change *default_free_pages*. Freed pages are added to the last of the free_area list.

#### How to improve the implemented FFMA?

1. As shown in the video, FFMA should maintain a sorted list according to the address of the pages.
2. To implement this, whenever adding nodes to the list of free pages, always add after the page with the largest address in pages with smaller address than the node to be added. Various algorithms could achieve this goal.
3. If the list was kept sorted, the time complexity for combining free blocks after pages were freed would hopefully be reduced to O(1) rather than O(n). 
4. Besides, if FFMA was implemented this way, the bug in Ex1.4 should not happen.

#### Differences from the answer provided
1. In the answer, the granulariry for page management in linked list is single page. For example, in *default_init_memmap* every page is linked to the list. 
2. In my code, the linked list contains blocks of continuous pages instead of single page. For example, in *default_init_memmap* only one page with the size of the free block is linked to the list.
3. It appears my code is faster because it saves time for list manipulation, on the otherhand the searching process for free blocks is faster.

#### List of knowledge
1. Operation of the elegant linked list.
2. Implementation of a FFMA.
3. Meanings of bits in a page entry.

## Ex2

#### Implementation of *get_pte*.

1. If the secondary page table containing the pte requested is present, then it's easy. 
    - Find the base of the secondary page table using page index of the directory table, then add the offset (index of secondary page) to the base, according to corresponding la of the page entry.
    - A tricky point is that entries in page directory table record physical base addresses for secondary tables, while the function should return virtual address of the secondary table entry. 
    - So after getting the (physical) address of the page table entry required, it should be converted to virtual address.
2. Otherwise, which means the secondary page table containing the pte requested is not present, then it need to be created first.
    - If the caller of *get_pte* does not allow creating page table, or attempt to create page table using *alloc_page* failed, the only option is to return NULL; 
    - After the memory for the page table is allocated, it should be initialized by setting all bits of the page table to 0, indicating all entries are currently unavailable.
    - And the ref number of the page containing the page table should be set to 1, because the newly allocated page is refered and only refered by a page directory entry.
    - The corresponding page directory entry (32 bit) should record this new page table by:
        - Recording the address of the page table in high 20 bits. This is enough for recording because the address of the page table is 4K aligned, which means the low 12 bits of the address are always 0.
        - Recording the permission of the page table in low 12 bits.

#### Meanings of components in page table directory and page table entries.
1. High 20 bits: the base address for next level of memory management module, which could be page table or page. These info are essensial for CPU to construct physical address from virtual address.
2. Low 12 bits: flags recording properties of the entry, including whether it presents, is writable, is changed and so on. The definations are in mmu.h. With these flags, ucore and CPU would be able to:
    - manage page table and cache page entry more effectively.
    - protect data from being accessed or wrote in a potentially hazardous manner.

#### If an exception happens while accessing a page, what would hardware do next?
1. Protect the context, such as values of %eip and %cs.
2. Pass the control to the kernel, which would carry out corresponding (page fault) ISR.

#### Differences from the answer provided
The difference is really small. At the last line I used a numeric calculation to get the address while the anwser establish an array first. I think with the comment mine is more readable.

#### List of knowledge

1. The relation among pages, addresses of pages, virtual address and physical address
2. The meaning of *page_ref*.

## Ex3

#### Implementation of *page_remove_pte*.
1. Check the argument. 
2. Find the page by pte, then break the connection between them. 
    - The ref number of the page is decreased by 1. If the ref number of the pages reaches 0, the page should be released.
    - the pte is erased by setting all bits of the pte to 0.
3. Invalidate the TLB for the pte (for it does not exist anymore).

#### The relationship between page array and page directory/table entry.
1. If the entry is present, then it is related to an item in the page array.
2. Because the relation between page array index and physical address is linear, with physical address recorded in the page directory/table entry, page array index could be obtained, as well as the address of the page array item.

#### What would you do if you want physical address identical to virtual address?
1. Change the address of kernel in link file to 0x00100000.
2. Change the base of the kernel in memlayout.h to 0x00000000.
3. Delete redundant protection when enabling page.

#### Differences from the answer provided
Exactly the same.

#### List of knowledge
1. The same as Ex2.
2. Controll over TLB.
